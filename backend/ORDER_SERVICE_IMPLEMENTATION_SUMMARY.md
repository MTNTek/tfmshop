# OrderService Implementation Summary

## Task 12: Build OrderService with checkout logic - COMPLETED ✅

### Implementation Overview

The OrderService has been fully implemented with comprehensive checkout logic, order management, and business rules. All required functionality has been implemented according to the task requirements.

### Completed Components

#### 1. OrderService Class ✅
**File:** `backend/src/services/OrderService.ts`

**Core Methods Implemented:**
- `createOrder()` - Complete checkout process with cart validation and order creation
- `calculateOrderTotals()` - Tax and shipping calculation with business rules
- `generateOrderNumber()` - Unique order number generation
- `getOrderById()` - Retrieve specific order for user
- `getOrderHistory()` - Paginated order history with filtering
- `updateOrderStatus()` - Order status management with validation
- `cancelOrder()` - Order cancellation with stock restoration
- `getOrderStatistics()` - Admin analytics and reporting

**Business Logic Features:**
- ✅ Cart validation before order creation
- ✅ Address handling (existing addresses or provided data)
- ✅ Tax calculation (8% configurable rate)
- ✅ Shipping calculation with free shipping threshold ($100+)
- ✅ Stock quantity management and updates
- ✅ Order status transition validation
- ✅ Automatic cart clearing after successful order
- ✅ Transaction safety with database rollback

#### 2. Tax and Shipping Calculation ✅

**Tax Calculation:**
- 8% tax rate applied to subtotal
- Configurable tax rate for easy updates
- Proper rounding to 2 decimal places

**Shipping Calculation:**
- $9.99 standard shipping rate
- Free shipping for orders $100 and above
- Configurable shipping rates and thresholds

**Example Calculations:**
```
Order $50.00:

- Tax (8%): $4.00  
- Shipping: $9.99
- Total: $63.99

Order $150.00:
- Subtotal: $150.00
- Tax (8%): $12.00
- Shipping: $0.00 (free)
- Total: $162.00
```

#### 3. Order Number Generation ✅

**Format:** `ORD{timestamp}{random}`
- Uses timestamp for uniqueness
- Adds 3-digit random number for collision prevention
- Format: `ORD12345678901` (14 characters total)
- Automatic collision detection and regeneration

#### 4. Order Status Management ✅

**Valid Status Transitions:**
- PENDING → CONFIRMED, CANCELLED

- CANCELLED/REFUNDED → (final states)

**Automatic Timestamps:**
- `shippedAt` set when status changes to SHIPPED
- `deliveredAt` set when status changes to DELIVERED
- Tracking number support for shipped orders

#### 5. Order History and Pagination ✅

**Features:**
- Paginated results with configurable page size
- Filtering by order status
- Date range filtering (start/end dates)
