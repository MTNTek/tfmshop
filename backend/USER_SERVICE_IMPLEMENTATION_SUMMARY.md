# UserService Implementation Summary

## Task 14: Implement user profile management - COMPLETED ✅

### Implementation Overview

The UserService has been fully implemented with comprehensive user profile management and address management functionality. All required methods have been implemented with proper validation, error handling, and business logic.

### Completed Components

#### 1. UserService Class ✅
**File:** `backend/src/services/UserService.ts`

**Profile Management Methods:**
- `getUserProfile()` - Retrieve user profile with addresses
- `updateProfile()` - Update user profile information with validation
- `validateProfileData()` - Validate profile update data
- `deactivateAccount()` - Deactivate user account
- `reactivateAccount()` - Reactivate user account
- `getUserStatistics()` - Get user statistics for admin purposes

**Address Management Methods:**
- `getUserAddresses()` - Get user addresses with filtering options
- `getAddressById()` - Get specific address by ID
- `createAddress()` - Create new address with validation
- `updateAddress()` - Update existing address
- `deleteAddress()` - Delete address
- `setDefaultAddress()` - Set address as default
- `getDefaultAddress()` - Get default address by type

#### 2. Profile Update Features ✅

**Supported Profile Updates:**
- ✅ First name and last name updates
- ✅ Email address changes with uniqueness validation
- ✅ Phone number updates with format validation
- ✅ Password changes with current password verification
- ✅ Input sanitization and trimming
- ✅ Required field validation

**Password Change Security:**
- Current password verification required
- New password strength validation
- Secure password hashing with bcrypt
- Minimum 8 characters with complexity requirements

**Email Change Validation:**
- Email format validation with regex
- Uniqueness check across all users
- Case-insensitive email handling
- Proper email normalization

#### 3. Address CRUD Operations ✅

**Address Creation:**
- Complete address validation
- Default address management
- Address type support (shipping/billing/both)
- Optional fields handling (company, phone, etc.)
- Custom labels and delivery instructions

**Address Updates:**
- Partial update support
- Default address switching
- Address type changes
- Validation for required fields

**Address Queries:**
- Filter by address type
- Filter by default status
- Ordered by default status and creation date
- User-scoped address access

**Default Address Logic:**
- Automatic clearing of other defaults when setting new default
- Type-specific default address handling
- Support for BOTH type addresses serving multiple purposes

#### 4. Validation and Error Handling ✅

**Profile Validation:**
- Email format validation
- Phone number format validation
- Password strength requirements
- Required field validation
- Empty field detection

**Address Validation:**
- Required field validation (firstName, lastName, addressLine1, city, state, postalCode)
- Postal code format validation
- Phone number format validation
- Input sanitization and trimming

**Error Handling:**
- Descriptive error messages
- User-friendly validation errors
- Security-conscious error responses
- Proper exception handling

#### 5. Type Definitions ✅
**File:** `backend/src/types/user.ts`

**Zod Validation Schemas:**
- `UpdateProfileSchema` - Profile update validation
- `AddressSchema` - Address creation validation
- `UpdateAddressSchema` - Address update validation
- `AddressQuerySchema` - Query parameter validation
- `ChangePasswordSchema` - Password change validation

**TypeScript Interfaces:**
- `UserProfileResponse` - Complete user profile response
- `AddressResponse` - Address details response
- `UserStatisticsResponse` - User statistics for admin
- `ProfileUpdateResponse` - Profile update response
- `AddressCreateResponse` - Address creation response

#### 6. Comprehensive Unit Tests ✅
**File:** `backend/tests/services/UserService.test.ts`

**Test Coverage:**
- ✅ User profile retrieval and validation
- ✅ Profile updates with various scenarios
- ✅ Email uniqueness validation
- ✅ Password change functionality
- ✅ Address CRUD operations
- ✅ Default address management
- ✅ Address filtering and querying
- ✅ Validation error handling
- ✅ User account activation/deactivation
- ✅ User statistics calculation

**Test Scenarios:**
- Valid and invalid profile updates
- Email change with conflict detection
- Password changes with security validation
- Address creation and management
- Default address switching logic
- Error handling for various edge cases

### Requirements Compliance

✅ **Requirement 2.1** - User profile update and address management methods
✅ **Requirement 6.3** - Address CRUD operations linked to user accounts

### Business Logic Features

**Profile Management:**
- Secure password changes with current password verification
- Email uniqueness enforcement
- Input sanitization and validation
- Account activation/deactivation support

**Address Management:**
- Multiple address support per user
- Address type categorization (shipping/billing/both)
- Default address management with automatic switching
- Address validation and completeness checking
- Custom labels and delivery instructions

**Security Features:**
- Password strength validation
- Secure password hashing
- User-scoped data access
- Input validation and sanitization
- Error message security

### Data Validation Rules

**Profile Data:**
- First name and last name: Required, non-empty, max 100 characters
- Email: Valid format, unique across users, normalized
- Phone: Optional, valid format when provided
- Password: Min 8 characters, uppercase, lowercase, number required

**Address Data:**
- Required fields: firstName, lastName, addressLine1, city, state, postalCode
- Postal code: 3-10 characters, alphanumeric with spaces/hyphens
- Phone: Optional, valid format when provided
- Country: Defaults to "United States"

### API Integration Points

**User Profile:**
- Profile retrieval with addresses
- Profile updates with validation
- Password changes with security
- Account management operations

**Address Management:**
- Address listing with filtering
- Address CRUD operations
- Default address management
- Address validation and formatting

### Error Handling

**Profile Errors:**
- User not found
- Email already in use
- Invalid current password
- Weak new password
- Invalid email format
- Empty required fields

**Address Errors:**
- Address not found
- Invalid address data
- Missing required fields
- Invalid postal code format
- Invalid phone number format

### Performance Considerations
