- **Production security headers** with CSP, HSTS, and other protections

### ‚úÖ 4. Database Seeding Scripts with Sample Data
- **Enhanced seeding system** (`src/scripts/seed.ts`):
  - Basic sample data (users, products, categories, orders)
  - Performance test data (1000+ products for load testing)
  - Realistic relationships and data variety
- **New seeding commands**:
  - `npm run seed:performance` - Add 1000+ test products
  - `npm run seed:full` - Complete dataset for testing
  - Existing commands enhanced with better data

### ‚úÖ 5. Logging and Monitoring Configuration for Production
- **Comprehensive monitoring system** (`src/utils/monitoring.ts`):
  - Real-time performance tracking
  - Memory and CPU usage monitoring
  - Database query performance tracking
  - Cache performance metrics
  - Configurable alerting thresholds
- **Enhanced logging** (`src/utils/logger.ts`):
  - Performance logging for slow operations
  - Security event logging
  - Database query logging
  - Structured logging with Winston
- **Health check system** with detailed system status
- **Production deployment scripts** (`src/scripts/production-deploy.ts`)

## üöÄ Additional Enhancements

Beyond the core requirements, several additional optimizations were implemented:

### Production Configuration
- **Environment-specific configurations** (`src/config/production.ts`)
- **Production validation** with comprehensive pre-deployment checks
- **Optimized database connection settings** for production workloads

### Monitoring and Alerting
- **Real-time performance monitoring** with configurable thresholds
- **Health check endpoints** (`/health`, `/metrics`)
- **Alert system** for memory usage, response times, and error rates
- **Performance summary dashboard** data

### Security Enhancements
- **Advanced threat detection** with pattern matching
- **Brute force protection** with automatic IP blocking
- **Request size limiting** and timeout protection
- **CORS optimization** with preflight caching

### Development Tools
- **Comprehensive deployment scripts** with validation
- **Performance testing data generation**
- **Production readiness checklist**
- **Monitoring and alerting tools**

## üìÅ Files Created/Modified

### New Files Created:
- `src/middleware/security.ts` - Advanced security middleware
- `src/utils/monitoring.ts` - Performance monitoring system
- `src/scripts/production-deploy.ts` - Production deployment tools
- `.env.production.example` - Production environment template
- `PERFORMANCE_OPTIMIZATION.md` - Comprehensive documentation
- `tests/performance/optimization.test.ts` - Performance feature tests

### Enhanced Existing Files:
- `src/config/database.ts` - Production-optimized database configuration
- `src/config/production.ts` - Enhanced production settings
- `src/app.ts` - Integrated new middleware and monitoring
- `src/scripts/seed.ts` - Added performance test data generation
- `package.json` - Added new deployment and seeding commands

## üß™ Testing and Validation

### Build Verification
- ‚úÖ TypeScript compilation successful
- ‚úÖ All new components properly integrated
- ‚úÖ No breaking changes to existing functionality

### Feature Testing
- ‚úÖ Performance monitoring components functional
- ‚úÖ Security middleware properly configured
- ‚úÖ Caching system operational
- ‚úÖ Rate limiting middleware active

## üìä Performance Metrics

The implementation provides monitoring for:
- **Response times** - Target < 500ms for most endpoints
- **Memory usage** - Alert at 85% heap usage
- **Error rates** - Alert at 5% error rate
- **Cache hit rates** - Target > 80% for frequently accessed data
- **Database query performance** - Alert for queries > 1 second

## üîß Configuration

### Environment Variables
Key performance-related environment variables:
```bash
ENABLE_CACHING=true
ENABLE_RATE_LIMIT=true
ENABLE_COMPRESSION=true
CACHE_DEFAULT_TTL=3600
RATE_LIMIT_GENERAL=500
SLOW_QUERY_THRESHOLD=1000
ALERT_MEMORY_USAGE=85
```

### Production Deployment
```bash
# Run pre-deployment checks
npm run deploy:check

# Full deployment process
npm run deploy

# Individual components
npm run deploy:migrate
npm run deploy:cache-warmup
npm run deploy:optimize
```

## üìà Expected Performance Improvements
