- `getRecentActivity()` - Recent system activity
- `getSystemHealth()` - System health monitoring

#### 4. Admin Routes ✅
**File:** `backend/src/routes/admin.ts`

**Route Protection:**
- All routes require authentication (`authenticateToken`)
- All routes require admin privileges (`requireAdmin`)
- Action logging for audit trails (`logAdminAction`)

**Request Validation:**
- Comprehensive Zod schemas for all endpoints
- Query parameter validation
