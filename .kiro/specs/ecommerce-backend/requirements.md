# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for building a comprehensive backend system for TFMshop, an e-commerce platform. The backend will provide REST APIs to support product management, user authentication, shopping cart functionality, order processing, and administrative features. The system needs to handle the current frontend requirements while being scalable and maintainable.

## Requirements

3. WHEN a user requests products by category THEN the system SHALL return products filtered by the specified category
4. WHEN a user requests product details THEN the system SHALL return complete product information including description, specifications, reviews, and related products
5. IF a product is out of stock THEN the system SHALL indicate unavailability in the product response

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a customer, I want to create an account and authenticate, so that I can access personalized features and make purchases.

#### Acceptance Criteria

6. WHEN a user requests password reset THEN the system SHALL send a secure reset link to their email

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a customer, I want to manage items in my shopping cart, so that I can collect products before purchasing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an authenticated user adds a product to cart THEN the system SHALL store the cart item with product details and quantity
2. WHEN a user updates cart item quantity THEN the system SHALL modify the stored quantity and recalculate totals
3. WHEN a user removes an item from cart THEN the system SHALL delete the cart item and update totals
4. WHEN a user views their cart THEN the system SHALL return all cart items with current pricing and availability
5. WHEN a user's session expires THEN the system SHALL preserve cart contents for registered users
6. IF a product becomes unavailable THEN the system SHALL notify the user and update cart status

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a customer, I want to place orders and track them, so that I can complete purchases and monitor delivery.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user initiates checkout THEN the system SHALL validate cart contents, calculate totals including taxes and shipping
2. WHEN a user completes payment THEN the system SHALL create an order record and clear the shopping cart
3. WHEN an order is created THEN the system SHALL generate a unique order number and send confirmation
4. WHEN a user requests order history THEN the system SHALL return their past orders with status and details
5. WHEN a user requests order details THEN the system SHALL return complete order information including items, pricing, and shipping status
6. WHEN order status changes THEN the system SHALL update the order record and notify the customer

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to manage products and inventory, so that I can maintain the product catalog.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an admin creates a product THEN the system SHALL store the product with all required details and make it available in the catalog
2. WHEN an admin updates product information THEN the system SHALL modify the stored product data and reflect changes immediately
3. WHEN an admin updates inventory levels THEN the system SHALL adjust stock quantities and update availability status
4. WHEN an admin deletes a product THEN the system SHALL remove it from the catalog while preserving order history references
5. WHEN an admin uploads product images THEN the system SHALL store and serve the images with appropriate optimization

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to manage orders and users, so that I can provide customer support and maintain the platform.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an admin views orders THEN the system SHALL return paginated order lists with filtering and sorting options

5. WHEN suspicious activity is detected THEN the system SHALL log security events and provide admin alerts

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want the backend to be reliable and performant, so that the platform can handle production traffic.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system receives concurrent requests THEN it SHALL handle them efficiently without data corruption
2. WHEN database operations fail THEN the system SHALL implement proper error handling and recovery mechanisms
3. WHEN API endpoints are called THEN the system SHALL respond within acceptable time limits (< 500ms for most operations)
4. WHEN the system experiences high load THEN it SHALL maintain functionality and provide graceful degradation
5. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL log detailed information for debugging while protecting sensitive data
